Each sculpture starts with a single strand of wire to sketch the outline and is then interlaced by hand to create the three dimensional details.

    "description": "From my cosy home studio nestled in the Norfolk countryside, I combine time-honoured printmaking traditions with fresh, contemporary colours to create botanical treasures that celebrate the quiet magic of British seasons. Rather than creating garden scenes or floral arrangements, I practice what's known as botanical portraiture – the intimate study of singular flowers and leaves. Like Georgia O'Keeffe's revolutionary approach to florals, I treat each bloom as a portrait subject, studying how flowers emerge from their stems, how leaves unfurl, how buds form part of the plant's complete story. This focused approach allows me to truly know my subjects. Working primarily at A6 and A5 scale, I can capture the essential character of Britain's everyday flowers – the humble daisy, resilient poppy, striking thistle – those often-overlooked blooms that have been my constant companions since childhood in the Scottish countryside.",

Each piece is handmade in Morocco by skilled female artisans using raffia, straw and leather, produced in small, considered batches with quality and longevity at the forefront.

A perfect harmony of craftsmanship and sustainability. All of our products are handmade by our small team in our local North East studio, including our stoneware candle pots! We are striving to be as eco-friendly as possible, so we also do refills for our candles which are designed to fit perfectly inside our candle pots, meaning you can use your pot over and over without having to throw it away! The dust covers on our candles are also made from Wildflower seed paper which means that when you have finished the last burn of your candle (and you no longer want to refill it) you can plant the seed paper and grow some lovely flowers in the pot! We also have a small range of greetings cards which are made from the wildflower seed paper and are fully plantable. We think these little extras are what make our little brand so special.",

She wanted to bring an intricate and ornate touch to a simple material such as metal. Specialising in ornamental arts, wreaths and sculptures, each piece is crafted entirely by hand using sustainable practices that will age beautifully over time developing a rich verdigris patina.

Each bloom is carefully gathered in its true season, then slowly pressed over weeks and often months, a patient ritual that captures not just the delicate beauty of the petals, but the whispers of folklore and memory they carry. Through this ancient craft, I preserve fleeting moments of nature’s enchantment, weaving tales of the earth into every pressed flower. This year, my work was honoured with five stars at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show a recognition that celebrates the quiet magic and timeless beauty of sustainably crafted botanicals. In my Atelier, I hold space for these stories, where petals become spells, and the passing of time is held gently between fragile leaves and stems",

    "description": "With a degree in Fine Art and a dabble in Interior Design after leaving Art College. I am continuously inspired by art, colour, beautiful fabrics, and an unconventional bohemian style and artistic spirit. This is my inspiration when creating beautiful, handmade accessories for hounds who aspire to be noticed. The excitement of sourcing beautiful fabrics brings me great pleasure and escapism. It allows momentary respite and a chance to recharge before jumping back into the fray, of running a small business alone. Working for myself allows me to bring together my two great passions. Creativity and my love of dogs. There is nothing more rewarding than helping to cement the magical marriage of humans and their dogs with something as simple as a new piece of neck-attire!",

Along the way I have learned that many of the most meaningful aspects of those cultures – craft, tradition, giving – are in danger of being lost because we simply don’t take the time to understand or appreciate them.",

We fell in love with these brave old hoses and mounted a rescue. Today, Elvis & Kresse's highly skilled craftspeople make beautifully designed accessories (bags, belts and wallets) and homeware from 15 different reclaimed materials. We now have several charitable partnerships and collaborations across industries. 50% of profits from the fire hose range go to The Fire Fighters Charity. 50% of the profits from our rescued leather pieces are donated to Barefoot College International. In 2021 Elvis & Kresse also took on a farm in order to establish a regenerative agriculture project, generate their own renewables and implement a host of environmental initiatives. Sustainable luxury since 2005: rescue, transform, donate.",

    "description": "At Fungo, we hand-blend functional herbal teas designed to support focus, memory, and wellbeing — without the caffeine. Our Elevate blend starts with organic Lion’s Mane mushroom extract, known for its brain-boosting benefits. We pair it with carefully chosen herbs and spices like tulsi, turmeric, ginger, and cinnamon — all sourced from small-scale organic farms in Sri Lanka. Every ingredient is selected for a reason, and we only use what’s needed — no fillers, no flavourings, nothing artificial. We craft our teas in small batches and taste every blend ourselves to make sure it’s as delicious as it is functional. Our goal? To make it easy (and enjoyable) to support your mind, every single day. We’re a small team, doing things properly — and proud to be bringing a little more calm, clarity, and connection to your daily brew.",

There is something so satisfying about reclaiming a bit of work top by hanging everything up! Of course whilst mixing in beautiful flowers and herb bunches and  random family nicknacks :) The problems we wanted to solve were to make a rail strong enough for a heavy cast iron pot, with hooks that stay on and don't come pinging off and end up behind the cooker! The hooks had to be wide enough to take any pan handle and strong enough to not bend. Also it had to look amazing! Chris, Deniz and Vermilion have worked on the design, admin and development of the products and Heidi and Summer have got really excited about what colours the rails should be and of course boxing up of the rails in our plastic free boxes.

Gruffydd enrolled onto a beekeeping course in Carmarthenshire that year and the 1 hive in the back of his mum and dad's garden quickly multiplied into over 200 beehives, dotted around rural South Wales today. The 100% pure, minimally filtered, unpasteurised (raw) Welsh honey that we produce has won numerous Great Taste Awards over the years and in 2024, our Welsh Wildflower Honey was awarded 3-stars meaning the judges class it as an 'exquisite extraordinarily tasty' honey. Gruffydd cares for all of our bees and I, Angharad (Gruff's wife) takes care of the business and produce all of our pure beeswax candles in our candle making studio on our honey farm.",

Each design starts as a twinkle of a memory, with photos for reference, pencil sketches layers of colour to create an original design. All our wallpapers are made in the UK. We partner with 100-year-old wallpaper manufacturers who work their magic fusing modern techniques with traditional heritage processes such as hand-screen printing metallics.

Most are made with paraffin wax, synthetic dyes, and artificial fragrances — ingredients that release harmful fumes when burned. At our studio, we’ve chosen a different path: crafting handmade birthday candles from natural waxes, with your health and the environment in mind. We use a gentle beeswax and soy wax — both biodegradable, clean-burning, and completely free from petroleum-based ingredients. These candles are designed to be safe enough to place on cakes and around children, without worrying about toxic smoke or chemical smells. Whether you’re celebrating a child’s birthday or marking a special milestone, our candles offer peace of mind with every flicker.",

This technique also known as 'verre églomisé' is a traditional process involving the precise application of designs in gold leaf onto the reverse of glass, creating an amazing and eye catching mirror like finish. By using this historical technique and putting my own twist to it, I make playful and colourful signs for your home or business. Each piece I hand paint on glass with 23ct gold gilding with an injection of bold and popping colours, a sprinkle of glitter and some fun loving expletives. All signs comes fully framed and ready to hang! What are you waiting for? Make your wall glisten!",

My focus is on functional ceramics for the modern family home, robust enough for daily use, but also design focused and distinct in form and finish. I work mainly with stoneware clay creating both hand-built and wheel thrown items within my homeware range. I have recently launched a new collection of bathroom basins alongside my ceramic home and tableware. I love the tactile nature of clay and enjoy working with textured clay bodies. I like to keep my glazes playful, and use colours ranging from calming aqua hues to bursts of bright colours here and there. Another passion of mine is styling and photographing my ceramics with fresh blooms from the garden. My work is very much connected to the nature surrounding me, and I am inspired by the changing seasons outside my studio door here in rural Berkshire. My studio is my creative hub, my calming sanctuary and the place where I can channel my passion and energy. Thanks for browsing my collection and I hope you find something that you love. Jenny x",

Each design is tested for durability, and they are varnished with a UV protective lacquer to seal their edges and protect their vibrant colours. Each sculpture is designed, individually printed, cut, assembled and embellished entirely by hand to make sure each and every one has its own unique character. Birds are my most favourite subject. I also make flowers and other wildlife. I am inspired by countryside walks and garden visitors. I often describe myself as a seasonal maker, as I can often be found at my desk making cosy pieces in the autumn and bright, cheerful blooms in the summertime. I’ve been making my sculptures for over 15 years now, and my work aims to evoke the joy I find in the great outdoors. I do hope they make you smile.",

    "description": "Karma Tea Co. was founded in 2019 by Alison, a tea lover with a simple mission: to make it easier for people to drink good tea -and do good while doing it. Born in London, the brand was inspired by the Sanskrit word karma (कर्म), meaning “action.” We believe that what you put out into the world comes back to you - which is why we’re here to make tea that’s good in every sense of the word. In an industry where profit often comes at the cost of people and the planet, Karma Tea Co. is different. We focus on single-origin, loose whole leaf teas that are sustainably grown, ethically sourced, and completely natural. Our karmic philosophy runs through everything we do -from how we choose our partners, to the way we source, blend, and package our teas. Because to make good tea, you have to do good first.",

I'm dedicated to creating everything sustainably; all my wrapping paper and cards are printed on 100% recycled paper and I use organic cotton for my tea towels. Everything is made in the UK. My favourite things to collage are always birds, but I’ve illustrated everything from ants to woolly mammoths, and, since buying my first home, I've slowly been covering the walls with swans and trees!",

My background is in Fine Art and I believe that gives my work a distinctive style which really suits homes which have a personality that develops over time and doesn't necessarily follow trends. Many of the materials I use are recycled, reclaimed, repurposed or upcycled, which enhances their intrinsic beauty and adds to the distinctive character that you only get from handmade. I combine vintage imagery with a rustic aesthetic, so my pieces really suit environments that combine inherited pieces, quirky collections and secondhand finds.",

My papers are made from a composition of reclaimed rag and plant fibres either left in their natural tones or imbued with natures living hues through the alchemy of botanical dyes. Each sheet is pulled from the vat by hand using time honoured and traditional paper-making techniques. My botanical illustrations are printed on my big beautiful antique printing press. Each sheet of handmade paper is fed one at a time into the press. The pressure of the printing plate combined with the pillowy paper creates a lovely fossil-like impression. I have worked hard to create a circular paper-making process that uses bi-product and reclaimed fibres. Nothing is wasted and everything is repurposed. I strive to save and use every last drop of botanical dye - reusing dye-baths where possible or turning leftover colour into pigments.",

Each piece is completely handmade by me in my studio, painted, cut and collaged or illustrated in my favourite mixed-media style. Pictures come signed, dated and framed or unframed. Perfect personalised presents for any occasion, and each one completely bespoke. I realised, having been drawing for well over 40 years, that aside from loving it as a career, it really makes me feel better too. Happily dOOdling every day, I’m embracing the power of drawing to calm the mind and unlock creativity. SO, I’ve also created a series of Doodling Books. Guided drawing for you to do anytime, anywhere. They’re great fun for folk young and old, and really do take you away from the hustle, bustle & technical treadmill we find ourselves on these days. Even just a five-minute pause can help such a lot. Thanks for having a peek at my page. I’d be delighted to make something for you. Lisa x",

I wanted to create a brand to explore my creativity and the aesthetics that I love. My business gives me the ability to explore my creativity and still be around for my children. My aim is to deliver luxury paper products with pretty illustrations for all occasions. I am hugely inspired by nature, and I love playing with colour combinations. All my designs are now created on the iPad Pro, and I tend to use a variety of techniques from pencil drawings to painting in gouache",

As a child, the family routine always included a Saturday visit to the department store where my dad worked. In my last year of high school I was on a programme where I went to school in the morning and worked at Bloomingdale's department store in the afternoon. I also started a little business then, buying costume jewellery from wholesalers in NYC and reselling locally. Fast forward to a move to London and a lengthy career in Visual Merchandising, where I devoted many years trying to ensure shops looked the best they could. With London Drying I've tried to use my aesthetic in a different way. Powered by music and good vibes, I hope my tea towels bring a smile.",

As an event designer in London, our founder Jessica Lucas was a magpie when it came to sourcing the unusual and one of a kind - so when a friend spotted a pair of towering church candles for sale in Madrid, they were too perfect a gift to leave behind (even if they wouldn’t fit in her suitcase). There was just one problem: she only had two of them. And so began a two and a half year hunt to source candles on a grand scale - and when she couldn’t, to find the artisans who would be able to make them. \"I created METRE Candles with that magic in mind. Whoever you are, whatever your reason, sometimes everyone just needs a moment to own something special.” - JESSICA LUCAS FOUNDER & DIRECTOR",

My hand-crafted ceramics are objects of empowerment, designed to evoke nostalgia and strength, whilst focusing on classical design. After the birth of our son Vincent, I decided to revisit my love of design and began to attend the drop-in classes at Clayspace. I found my calling and instantly began to spend all my waking hours there. I’ve not stopped since and most of my time is usually spent creating handmade ceramic pieces from inspiration and explorations.",

Being sustainable is central to Mortlake Papers, our products are made of FSC recycled paper; this means that 100% of it is made from recycled materials.

I’m drawn to nature’s shapes and textures, letting them inspire pieces that feel organic and grounded.

Each piece is shaped, fired, and glazed by hand, celebrating the slow, mindful rhythm of making. Whether it’s a personalised gift or a little something for yourself, my pottery is made to bring joy, connection, and a touch of whimsy to everyday life.",

Because food waste is totally nuts, we are changing daily rituals, nibble by nibble. At nibs etc. we're on a mission to design 'waste' out of our dictionaries. We celebrate nutritious yet misunderstood ingredients – byproducts – such as British apple juice pulp which is naturally high in fibre, and marry them with high quality ingredients. Food waste is one of the biggest contributors to climate change, according to Project Drawdown. By upcycling ingredients that otherwise get thrown away, we not only tackle the environmental issues but also the socio-economic challenges posed by wasteful supply chains; by making sure valuable nutrients such as fibre and protein are being used to feed humans, and not animals, energy or landfill.",

Our goal is to reconnect with this natural cycle, working with nature not against it and securing a thriving future for our planet and the generations to come. Our female team handcrafts our wares in small batches using rescued, repurposed & recycled materials rather than virgin supplies. We keep your health at the forefront of our minds, using non-toxic, naturally derived ingredients.

Whether crafting with twigs or foraging alongside my father, nature has always been a significant part of my life. Jewellery has been a passion of mine for many years. My journey began at age eight, making friendship bracelets in a pottery class, and evolved to silver wire-wrapping sea glass in later years. Each step has led me closer to where I am meant to be—here, creating unique pieces that reflect my connection to the natural world. Becoming a mother to our two beautiful daughters, Winnie and Piper, has inspired me and fostered growth in ways I could never have imagined. Lastly, none of this would be possible without my husband, Angus.",

My pieces are designed to be both works of art, and functional robust pieces for the home. Each piece is meticulously crafted by hand, creating organically shaped pieces which are then painted and glazed by hand, ensuring that no two pieces are alike. The speckled, earthy tones of the stoneware are designed to balance the brightly coloured glazed patterns. Shaping each piece by hand means they are all intentionally slightly different, and aims to emphasise my belief in creating unique, slow, sustainable pieces for the home. I draw inspiration from the living world around me, earthy colours inspired from nature which are complemented by traditional patterns such as check or gingham mixed with architectural shapes and often finished with a pop of bright colour. The beauty in hand crafted functional pieces really inspires me, beautifully crafted items from the past which have been used hundreds of times over the years each telling a story.",

Our desire was to recycle the shells generated at our family's seafood processing business, rather than sending them to landfill. We’ve been processing shellfish here on the West coast of Wales for over 40 years. We currently specialise in processing whelks. The whelks are caught locally in traditional pots, a low impact method of fishing which means minimal damage to the sea floor and marine habitats. We’re passionately committed to sustainability and are always looking for new ways to do better. It's estimated that 5,000 tonnes of waste shells are generated in the UK fishing industry every year. We’re proud to not only reduce our waste output from the factory, but also to help support a circular economy by utilising 100% of the whelks we process.",

With a strong interest in hand made craft everything has either been created in house by Hannah, or designed and made by specialist artisans.

Nestled in the South Downs national park, we created our first organic cotton clothing collection in 2010 and we’ve stuck to our sustainable philosophy ever since.

The cakes started as an offshoot of Milly’s catering business, baked in the farmhouse kitchen and sold at various food festivals. By 2002 the cakes were in full swing and sales began to grow. Before long we had grown out of our home kitchen and started converting redundant outbuildings and stables outside our back door, where the bakery still remains today. All the cakes are handmade to our own traditional recipes, then baked in small batches, so that production can be personally supervised by Milly. Where possible, we source ingredients locally – free range eggs from the farm over the hill behind us and English butter. Presentation is a big thing for us too. Our cake packaging is contemporary in design and we strive for the highest standard, whether the cake is eaten at home, or given away as a present. All our mail order cakes are sent out in the post in a gorgeous gift box, with our eye catching branding. And very importantly all our packaging is recyclable.",

    "description": "My name is Elle and I run Speckled Grey. I love to make satisfyingly tactile wares to celebrate everyday life. My work is all about bright, matte colours and soft, hand-carved textures. I work by slip-casting with silky Parian porcelain and polishing up each piece to be huggable in your hands. This creates a soothing but vibrant aesthetic to cheer your senses and help create a home you adore. After my degree, I spent ten years as a delftware painter whilst honing my skills as a maker. I'm continuously learning about this brilliant material and tweaking and refining my practice all the time. I’ve been lucky enough to see my work visit some wonderful places and I hope you find something to treasure here!",

    "description": "Tea is too cheap. We’ve been drinking tea for 300 years. A kilo of tea cost around £1,000 back then, now you can get a kilo for £2. Mad. Hard work goes into growing, picking, processing, packing, branding and selling tea. But the rewards for doing each job are not equal. Most of the money is made in the UK. Too little is made where the tea is grown. Traditionally, tea brands buy teas from different countries and blend them all together. You can't buy tea from a smallholder farmer directly. It has to be processed by the factory before it can be bought. And tea can be bought in a mixture of ways... Some direct from the factory, some via auction, some via brokers or traders. Sometimes, a mixture. This makes things murky. And makes it difficult to know what the smallholder farmer who grew the tea has been paid. That can't be right. So we thought \"let's start again\". Find a great tasting tea that hits the spot. Buy the tea direct. Talk to farmers, understand what they need. Pay the farmers more. Be open about payments to farmers. For you, a better cuppa. For the farmer, a better price.",

However, there were no products on the market that really grabbed his attention. So we put our time into something both creative and productive and together, we created The Brighton Beard Co.; and the rest as they say, is history. And Lloyd’s beard lived happily ever after.",

I also supported the Grenada Chocolate Company fundraising to help them through this difficult time. I have invested in an organic cocoa farm in Grenada and the harvest is available to the chocolate company who make some of the best chocolate I have ever tasting in the perfect circular economy that also respects the environment.

I also love classic typefaces, bold colours and an ever-present sense of how good prints can make a real instant impact. As you will see - I can rarely resist sprinkling a sense of humour in to the mix too! Running through everything I do is my passion to help keep heritage crafts alive and to enjoy that sense of a historical connection to the printers, presses and ephemera that have come before me. I also truly believe in the benefits of slowing down, switching off and zoning into the deep focus that this process of discovery inspires in me. In a world where everything is too fast, I enjoy nothing more than closing my studio door and diving into the rich and ever-rewarding world of letterpress printmaking.",

When I'm not drawing pictures or thinking up jolly japes for cards, I can be found chasing after my two daughters, bouncing on our trampoline or eating ice lollies, often all at the same time.",

I design and make pennant flags to uplift and motivate or just create that little bit of warm nostalgia in your home or on your travels. Inspired by 1950s Americana with a touch of Irish warmth. I am passionate about classic craftsmanship. I love to use as many analog methods as I can when when making my flags. The journey of my flags begins when I hand draw the artwork and ink it onto paper first, this is then transferred to a heavy duty canvas flag that I make using my old 1960s Singer sewing machine ( I take this very seriously regards concentration and attention to detail as you can see from my profile pic lol ). I then type a personal thank you letter on my old Olivetti typewriter that I include with every order. I did say I love vintage, analog methods and classic craftsmanship so it brings me nothing but joy and happiness if I where to make a flag for you.",

I have met so many amazing people and businesses over the last 5 years. Some of my highlights so far include appearing on James Martin, making the Finals of the Great British Entrepreneur Awards and supplying Harrods. I am always blown away to hear Italians raving about our Yorkshire Pasta and hearing stories of it being sent to Italy to show family!

And in recent years by the incredible island I now call home.

So with over 20 years experience in developing footwear for top high street brands, I decided to create the product I wanted to buy for my own kids... Sustainably designed, Podiatrist Approved, Unisex footwear that would last longer and reduce waste. In collaboration with a Paediatric Podiatrist we created an innovative removable midsole that adds half a size to the fitting of the shoe, lasting up to 6 months longer. We select all materials for durability and biodegradable-friendly. Our designs are cool classics that do not date and can be passed down from brother to sister. And when you've finished with them, we offer free donation and recycling services. Everything we do supports our mission to ensure \"No ZIG+STARs to ever end in landfill\"",
