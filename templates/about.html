  <h1>About Most Reviews</h1>

  <p>In a world where <strong>over 4 billion pieces of content are published every day</strong>, independent small businesses are being drowned out by the noise. <strong>Most Reviews</strong> was created to change that, raising the profile of independent small businesses and celebrating the products customers truly love.</p>

  <p>We have used AI to generate detailed data models so that we can share which products and partners are trending on <strong>Not On The High Street</strong>. We have also created a complete A–Z directory showcasing the products with the most reviews for each NOTHS partner.</p>

  <p>Our <em>Top 100 Products</em> and <em>Top 100 Partners</em> rankings refresh monthly, while other insights are updated more frequently.</p>

  <p>Our goal is simple: to cut through the noise and make it easier for customers to discover the products people genuinely love and for independent small businesses to get the recognition they deserve.</p>

  <h2>About Not On The High Street</h2>

  <p>
    Not On The High Street (NOTHS) is a UK online marketplace founded in 2006 by
    <strong>Holly Tucker</strong> and <strong>Sophie Cornish</strong>, created to champion creative,
    independent businesses.
  </p>

  <p>
    The platform connects customers with thousands of small brands offering original products that
    aren’t found on the high street — from personalised gifts and homeware to jewellery, fashion,
    and food.
  </p>

  <p>
    With more than <strong>300,000 products</strong> listed, NOTHS plays a significant role in
    helping small businesses reach a wider audience. At the same time, the sheer scale of the
    marketplace can make it challenging for customers to quickly identify which products are the
    most trusted and most loved.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is where data can help. By analysing customer reviews across the marketplace, it’s possible
    to surface clear signals of quality, popularity, and consistency — helping shoppers make more
    confident choices while giving outstanding independent brands the visibility they’ve earned.
