  <h1>About Most Reviews</h1>

  <p><strong>Most Reviews by Wue</strong> is a platform designed to celebrate and support small businesses — especially in a world increasingly shaped by giants like Amazon, Temu, and Shein.</p>

  <p>Using our own AI-powered tools, we’ve built a growing database of independent sellers on <strong>Not On The High Street</strong>, highlighting the most loved products and the most reviewed shops over the past 12 months.</p>

  <p>This site is updated monthly to spotlight what’s trending, what’s working, and what customers are raving about.</p>

  <p>We’re huge fans of the NOTHS community and created Most Reviews to amplify the amazing work of its sellers.</p>

  <p>If you’re a brand or organisation that would like access to more detailed insights — or want to work together — we’d love to hear from you at 
    <a href="mailto:info@mostreviews.co.uk">info@mostreviews.co.uk</a>.
